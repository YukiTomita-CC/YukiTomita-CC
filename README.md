## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a hobbyist diving into the fascinating world of Natural Language Processing (NLP). My current private project is building an LLM system I've named **N.O.A.H.** (_Never Outdone Artificial HyperIntelligence_).\
(Yeah, the "Never Outdone" part is just a joke. I named the project like this because I'm a big Tony Stark fan! ðŸ˜‚)

I'm just an amateur enjoying the exciting developments in NLP these days. **N.O.A.H.** is trained on a lot of personal data, so, I can't share it publicly. But, I'm hoping to share any insights and learnings I gain along the way.

Since I'm not a professional programmer or NLP expert, I'd really appreciate any feedback if I'm not following best practices.
